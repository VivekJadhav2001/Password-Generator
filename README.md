# Password Generator

## Overview
This project is a **Password Generator** application built using **React.js**. It allows users to generate random passwords with customizable options, including length, numeric characters, and special characters. Users can also copy the generated password to the clipboard with a single click.

---

## Features
- **Dynamic Password Length**: Users can select a password length between 6 and 100 characters.
- **Include Numbers and Symbols**: Options to include numbers and special characters in the generated password.
- **Real-time Updates**: Password updates dynamically based on the selected options.
- **Clipboard Support**: Copy the generated password to the clipboard with a single button click.

---

## Technologies Used
- **React.js**: Frontend framework used for building the UI.
- **Tailwind CSS**: For styling and responsive design.
- **JavaScript Hooks**: Utilizes `useState`, `useCallback`, `useEffect`, and `useRef` for state management, rendering optimizations, and DOM manipulation.

## Hooks and Concepts Used
1. **useState**: Manages state for length, allowed numbers, allowed characters, and the generated password.
2. **useCallback**: Optimizes performance by memoizing functions.
3. **useEffect**: Automatically regenerates the password whenever dependencies change.
4. **useRef**: Accesses DOM elements directly for clipboard copying functionality.

---

## Usage Instructions
1. Adjust the **password length** using the slider.
2. Enable or disable **numbers** and **special characters** by checking the respective boxes.
3. Copy the generated password to your clipboard using the **Copy** button.

---

## Future Enhancements
- Add theme customization (light/dark mode).
- Display password strength indicator.
- Option to exclude ambiguous characters (e.g., `l`, `1`, `0`, `O`).
- Download password as a text file.
